  abstract = {We describe the specification and proof of an
                 (imperative, sequential) hash table implementation. The
                 usual dictionary operations (insertion, lookup, and so
                 on) are supported, as well as iteration via folds and
                 iterators. The code is written in OCaml and verified
                 using higher-order separation logic, embedded in Coq,
                 via the CFML tool and library. This case study is part
                 of a larger project that aims to build a verified OCaml
                 library of basic data structures.}
